                <p className="my-3 mx-3 text-start">I was born and raised in Nashville, but my cultural background goes much deeper than that. I am a proud son of Latino immigrants from Honduras. My family has been here in the United States for over 25 years now, and we have all worked hard to establish a home. Growing up, I was exposed to the vibrant music, dance, and food of my cultural heritage. I learned to appreciate the importance of family and community in Honduran culture and developed a strong connection to my ancestors and their traditions. I am bilingual, speaking Spanish and English fluently, with the ability to read and write.</p>
                <p className="my-3 mx-3 text-start">As a Latino with Honduran roots, I am proud to have a cultural background that is rich in history and tradition. My family's roots in Honduras are an important part of my identity and have shaped my perspective on the world. Today, I am proud to identify as both Latino and Honduran-American, and I continue to celebrate my cultural heritage through food, music, and other traditions. My hope is to inspire others to learn more about the rich diversity of Latino cultures and to embrace the importance of heritage in shaping our identities.</p>
